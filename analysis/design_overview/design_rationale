# Design Rationale

## Objective
To design a small two-stage gearbox, suitable for applications in small driven robotic vehicles.

## Design Goals
- Increase torque
- Reduce speed
- Maintain compact size

## Gear Selection
Spur gears were chosen as the simplest method to transfer motion and torque.

## Shaft Selection
Steel shafts with bores between 8-12mm were chosen to transfer motion and prevent bending.

## Bearing Selection
Standard deep-groove ball bearings were chosen as the most appropriate and easily available bearings.

## Housing Selection
A rectangular housing was chosen to protect the internal components, with an open base to allow for assembly and maintenance.
