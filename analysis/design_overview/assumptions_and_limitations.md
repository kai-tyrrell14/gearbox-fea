# Assumptions and Limitations

## Purpose
The purpose of this document is to outline the assumptions and limitations that were applied during the design process of this project.

## Design Assumptions

### Loading Conditions
- The gearbox was analysed under steady-state loading.
- Loads were assumed to be primarily radial with negligible axial forces.

### Material Properties
- All components are assumed to be manufactured from homogenous, isotropic materials.
- Standard material properties were used for analysis.

### Gear Interaction
- Ideal involute gear meshing was assumed.
- No backlash or interference.
- Negligible frictions losses between gears. 

### Bearing Behaviour
- Bearings are press fit and rigidly supported by the housing.

### Assembly Constraints
- All shafts and gears are perfectly aligned.

## Simulation Assumptions

### FEA Simulations
- Only static structural analysis was performed.
- Contact stresses were approximated using simple loading regions.
- Mesh refinement was applied near stress concentration areas.

### Motion Study Assumptions
- No slip or efficiency losses.
- Motor input speed is constant.

## Design Limitations
- Fatigue and long-term wear were not evaluated.
- Lubrication effects not considered.
- Tolerances and assembly variation were not considered.
